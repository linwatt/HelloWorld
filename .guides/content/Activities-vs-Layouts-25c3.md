1) The device launches your app and creates an activity object.
2) The activity object specifies a layout.
3) The activity tells Android to display the layout on screen.
4) The user interacts with the layout thatâ€™s displayed on the device.
5) The activity responds to these interactions by running application code.
6) The activity updates the display...
7) ...which the user sees on the device.
